.SH NAME
jtb \- syntax tree builder for JavaCC
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B jtb
.RI [ options ] " inputfile"
.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page documents briefly the \fBjtb\fR command.
.PP
JTB (Java Tree Builder) is a syntax tree builder and visitors generator to be
used in front of JavaCC (Java Compiler Compiler).  It takes a JavaCC grammar
file as input (usually a ".jtb" file) and automatically generates the
following:
.RS
.PP
\- a set of syntax tree classes based on the productions in the grammar,
utilizing the Visitor design pattern;
.PP
\- four interfaces: IVoidVisitor, IVoidArguVisitor, IRetVisitor,
IRetArguVisitor;
.PP
\- four depth-first visitors: DepthFirstVoidVisitor, DepthFirstVoidArguVisitor,
DepthFirstRetVisitor, DepthFirstREtArguVisitor, whose default methods simply
visit the children of the current node; a JavaCC grammar ".jj" file (jtb.out.jj
by default), with the proper annotations to build the syntax tree during
parsing (which then must be compiled with JavaCC).
.RE
.PP
New visitors, which subclass any generated one, can then override the default
methods and perform various operations on and manipulate the generated syntax
tree.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-cl\fR
Print a list of the classes generated to standard out.
.TP
\fB\-d \fIdir\fR
"\fB\-d \fIdir\fR" is short for (and overwrites) "\fB\-nd \fIdir\fR/syntaxtree \fB\-vd \fIdir\fR/visitor".
.TP
\fB\-dl\fR
Generate depth level info.
.TP
\fB\-e\fR
Suppress JTB semantic error checking.
.TP
\fB\-f\fR
Use descriptive node class field names.
.TP
\fB\-h\fR
Display this help message and quit.
.TP
\fB\-ia\fR
Inline visitors accept methods on base classes.
.TP
\fB\-jd\fR
Generate JavaDoc\-friendly comments in the nodes and visitor.
.TP
\fB\-nd \fINAME\fR
Use \fINAME\fR as the package for the syntax tree nodes.
.TP
\fB\-np \fINAME\fR
Use \fINAME\fR as the package for the syntax tree nodes.
.TP
\fB\-ns \fINAME\fR
Use \fINAME\fR as the class which all node classes will extend.
.TP
\fB\-o \fINAME\fR
Use \fINAME\fR as the filename for the annotated output grammar.
.TP
\fB\-p \fINAME\fR
"\fB\-p \fIpkg\fR" is short for (and overwrites) "\fB\-np \fIpkg\fR.syntaxtree \fB\-vp \fIpkg\fR.visitor".
.TP
\fB\-pp\fR
Generate parent pointers in all node classes.
.TP
\fB\-printer\fR
