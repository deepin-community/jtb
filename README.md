# jtb

JTB is a syntax tree builder to be used with the Java Compiler Compiler (JavaCC) parser generator. 
JTB was originally developped at UCLA up to version 1.3.2 (http://compilers.cs.ucla.edu/jtb/) or (http://compilers.cs.ucla.edu/jtb/jtb-2003/).
It has been upgraded in version 1.4.0+ (2009-2010), as an embedded tool within the SourceForge Eclipse JavaCC plugin. 
It is now (2011) provided as a standalone tool in the same hosting environment as JavaCC.
